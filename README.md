The Excel macro created performs a comprehensive analysis of stock market data through the following features:

* Iterating through each worksheet in the workbook to process multiple datasets.
* Calculating the yearly change, percent change, and total stock volume for each unique stock ticker.
* Formatting and presenting the calculated data in a summary table for each worksheet.
* Identifying the stocks with the greatest percent increase, greatest percent decrease, and greatest total volume across all worksheets.
* Presenting the results in a separate summary table, indicating the tickers and corresponding values.
